        <h1>Weekly Movie Rating: week 3</h1>
        <p>I will be rating movies from 1-10 every week based on: cinematography, plot, acting, and overall entertainment. Movies provide both stress relief and entertainment for many people including me. Movies can allow people to open up thier mind to another world making them question theirs, another reason they are so entertaining.</p>
