        <ul>
            <li>Cinematography:9/10- Swiss Army Man is, perhaps unsurprisingly, a highly distinctive work, one that unites its gorgeous cinematography, DIY special effects, and soaring music.</li>
            <li>Plot:9/10- Being stranded on a deserted island leaves young Hank (Paul Dano) bored, lonely and without hope. As a rope hangs around his neck, Hank prepares to end it all, until he suddenly spots a man (Daniel Radcliffe) laying by the shore. Unfortunately, he is dead and quite flatulent. Using the gassy body to his advantage, Hank miraculously makes it back to the mainland. However, he now finds himself lost in the wilderness, and dragging the talking corpse named Manny along for the adventure.</li>
            <li>Acting:9.5/10- Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe are amazing from beginning to end. I loved the characters and the fact that I cared so much about a dead body just shows how well-written this was.</li>
            <li>Overall entertainment:8/10- A very strange movie but entertaining for sure.</li>
        </ul>
