    <h2>Weekly movie ratings</h2>

    <p>I will be rating movies from 1-10 every week based on: cinematography, plot, acting, and overall entertainment. Movies provide both stress relief and entertainment for many people including me. Movies can allow people to open up thier mind to another world making them question theirs, another reason they are so entertaining. </p>

    <h3>Movie of the week:</h3>

    <p>This weeks movie is: Mother! 
       <ul>
        <li>Cinematography: 10/10- Cinematographer Matthew Libatique, cretates a scary mood with the use of colors. </li>
        <li>Plot: 10/10- Director Darren Aronfsky, also known for Black Swan, Requiem for a Dream, and other hit movies, tells a redesigned story of christianity and question of god and creation.  </li>
        <li>Acting: 10/10- Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem create a chilling dynamic with their acting. Javier being in the roll of god and creation and Jennifer being mother nature, mother so desperately trying to maintain her home while god letting in destructive visitors. </li>
        <li>Overall entertainment: 9.5/10- I say this because there are parts of the movie where there is just overall anxiety and dread. Which is not necessarily a bad thing but it's not the most entertaining to feel like that. </li>
       </ul>
