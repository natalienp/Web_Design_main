        <li>Cinematography:10/10- Cinematography by Peter Deming, Deming creates a almost cult like feel with the useage of symmetry and balance. </li>
        <li>Plot:9/10- Director Mark Mylod brings a healthy balance of entertainment and satire to his audience, accented by delicious performances from a cast of characters that make us question what a fine dining experience should look like.
        </li>
        <li>Acting:9/10- Anya Taylor-Joy as Margot Mills, Ralph Fiennes as Chef Slowik, and Nicholas Hoult as Tyler, each connect to give a interesting dynamic.</li>
        <li>Overall entertainment:8/10- 
            As horror-satire goes, The Menu isn't especially sophisticated. And true foodies can probably poke holes in every course. But in its own insistently odd way, the film is a good deal of palate-cleansing fun. </li>
    </ul>
