        <p>While there's still lots of Cullen gray and Forks winter gear, Jasper and Rosalie's back stories take place in different eras, so the costumes are amazing. The Volturi are eerie and fashion-forward, vamping it up, as usual.        </p>

        <h3>Warewolves or Shape-shifters?</h3>
        <img src="images_final/bike.jpeg.webp" alt="image5">
        <p>Shape-shifters, often mistaken as werewolves, are descended from the ancient spirit warriors of the Quileute tribe. Back then, warriors and chiefs could leave their bodies and wander as spirits, communicate with animals, and hear each other's thoughts.

        <h4>Twilight: Rosalie Cullen’s Dark Backstory Explained </h4>
        <img src="images_final/rip.jpeg.webp" alt="image4">       
        <p>The Twilight saga's minor player Rosalie is one of the Cullen Clan’s less utilized members, but she has an interesting and shockingly dark backstory that makes for a compelling narrative of its own. Released in 2008, Catherine Hardwicke’s Twilight was the beginning of a blockbuster series of movie adaptations for Stephenie Meyer’s teen romance phenomenon of the same name.</p>
