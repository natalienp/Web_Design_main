   <h2>Plot</h2>
    <p>After Bella recovers from the vampire attack that almost claimed her life, she looks to celebrate her birthday with Edward and his family. However, a minor accident during the festivities results in Bella's blood being shed, a sight that proves too intense for the Cullens, who decide to leave the town of Forks, Washington for Bella and Edward's sake. Initially heartbroken, Bella finds a form of comfort in reckless living, as well as an even-closer friendship with Jacob Black. Danger in different forms awaits.</p>

    <h2>Romeo and Juliet refrences explained </h2>
    <img src="images_final/moon.jpeg" alt="Twilight1">
    <p>Series creator Stephenie Meyer may claim that New Moon is based on Romeo & Juliet, but how much does the second Twilight novel (and movie adaptation) really resemble Shakespeare’s play? Released in 2008, Twilight was the first in a series of blockbuster teen fantasy romance movies based on the novel series of the same name by author Stephenie Meyer. The Twilight movies fared well with audiences but suffered in terms of critical reception. 2009’s first sequel, New Moon, was singled out as the least-lauded of the lot. </p>

    <p>"'New Moon' is little more than a skilful soap opera, but it's still enjoyable escapism - even if you're old and wise enough to see through it."</p>

    <h4>Fun Facts!</h4>
    <img src="images_final/fall.jpeg.webp" alt="image5">
    <p>Summit Entertainment greenlit this sequel one day after Twilight (2008) had opened in cinemas. The ring Bella wears on her index finger the whole movie is set with a large moonstone. In the school parking lot scene, it is Bella 18th birthday. That scene was shot on April 9, which was Kristen Stewart's 19th birthday.</p>
